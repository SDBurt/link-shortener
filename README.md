# Link Shortener

This repository contains the code for a link shortener app largly based on the open source project [dub.sh](https://dub.sh) with aspects from the Nextjs template [Taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn/taxonomy/tree/main/app). I haven not decided on a name of it yet.

The app has two subdomains. The main (_http://localhost:3000_) is used as a default for redirecting, while the second (ex: *http://app.localhost:3000*) is the dashboard for creating and managing projects and links.

## To Do

- [ ] implement projects with custom domains
- [ ] better dashboard
- [ ] project invitations
